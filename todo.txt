Add ao3 gifts.

Caching:
  When parsing a work:
    parse the id
    check the cache for the id
    if found, check update date (gonna have to find some way around this for ao3, I think, since I don't want to be making 20 requests every page constantly)
    if not found, or if out of date, parse and add to cache
  When doing a query:
    get a page of results like normal, and parse
    filter the parsed results according to the normal filter
    check the cache to see if this has cached results
    If so, stop requesting. If not, request another page.

  Parse Terms
  Cache Queries
  get page from qs
    compare to cached
    on cache miss, insert/update database
    on cache hit, break
  query db from terms
    terms -> db query object
