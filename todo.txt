Add ao3 gifts.

Caching:
  When parsing a work:
    parse the id
    check the cache for the id
    if found, check update date (gonna have to find some way around this for ao3, I think, since I don't want to be making 20 requests every page constantly)
    if not found, or if out of date, parse and add to cache
  When doing a query:
    get a page of results like normal, and parse
    filter the parsed results according to the normal filter
    check the cache to see if this has cached results
